## General Information
Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using person's face. Face recognition can be made by using eigenface algorithm. Eigenface is formed by finding its eigenvalue and eigenvector. To find eigenvalue and eigenvector, we use the QR decomposition using the gram-schmidt method (find from the covarian matrix).
